    @description = description = A radial tank perfect for storing small quantities of Karbonite. Granted, this does not in any way increase the safety margins, but it does reduce the size of the crater you will leave behind.

{
    @description = This simple container turned out to be very useful for carrying small junk items into space. Creative engineers sometimes find additional uses for it, like carrying resources or science experiments. Or, in this case, carrying a small but terrifying amount of highly explosive Karbonite.
